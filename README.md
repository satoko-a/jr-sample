# JSONAPI::Resource sample

This is a example project.

With `SomeResource < AbstractResouce < GrandAbstractResource`, we get warning messages "MODEL NOT FOUND".
Of course AbstractResouce and GrandAbstractResource is `abstract` but I can't help it.

```
[MODEL NOT FOUND] Model could not be found for AbstractResource. If this a base Resource declare it as abstract.
```
